Once you do that, you can run them at least three ways, in combination with your ./dequer program:
       1.Just display responses to commands you type: ./dequer | ./showdequer 
       2.Use a graphical interface to feed commands into your program: ./cmddequer | ./dequer 
       3.Make a `dequer sandwich' with commands from a graphical interface and results to a graphical display: ./cmddequer | ./dequer
         | ./showdequer
